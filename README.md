# OCR GCE A LEVEL COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMMING PROJECT H446-03

### Picture This!
This repository contains the development of my Computer Science A Level programming project.

My project is a unique take on the popular web-based game [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/ "skribbl.io"). It follows similar principles, however, _Picture This!_ will add the component of solving rebus puzzles! If you would like to learn more, documentation will be added soon so keep an eye out...

### Result
After having completed this project to a reasonable point, and submitting the project for marking, I was awarded an A* for my coursework.
